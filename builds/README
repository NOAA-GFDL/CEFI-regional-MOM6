This tool can be use to build the executable for the model.
E.g., on machine gaea for platform c5 with intel23 compiler:

./linux-build.bash -m gaea -p ncrc5.intel23 -t prod -f mom6sis2

This assumes that the files build/gaea/ncrc5.intel23.env and build/gaea/ncrc5.intel23.mk exist.
-  build/gaea/ncrc5.intel23.env contains all the necessary environment variables and modules
that must be loaded before a build / run on that machine
-  build/gaea/ncrc5.intel23.mk  contains the compile instructions for the particular compiler and machine
