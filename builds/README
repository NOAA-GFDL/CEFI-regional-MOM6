This tool can be use to build the executable for the model.
E.g., on machine gaea for platform intel21:

./linux-build.bash -m gaea -p intel21 -t prod -f mom6sis2

This assumes that the files build/gaea/intel21.env and build/gaea/intel21.mk exist.
-  build/gaea/intel21.env contains all the necessary environment variables and modules
that must be loaded before a build / run on that machine
-  build/gaea/intel21.mk  contains the compile instructions for the particular compiler and machine

To build COBALT only with openACC
./linux-build.bash -m lscgpu50 -p pgi20 -t repro-managedACC -f mom6sis2
