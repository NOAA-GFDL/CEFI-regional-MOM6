====================================
Analysis output
====================================

The ``CEFI-regional-MOM6/diagnostics`` folder contains python scripts that can be used to analyze modeled physical and biogeochemical results. 
Please contact the code manager `Yi-cheng.Teng <yi-cheng.teng@noaa.gov>`_ if you have any queations.

.. note::

   At this point, all the scripts require model outputs that are post-processed by FRE. Users with GFDL PPAN access should be able to use these scripts directly. We are still working on a containerized approach for the post-processing process and will update once it is available.


To run the diagnostics scripts, users can follow the steps below:

   #. :ref:`Prerequisite <Prerequisite>`
   #. :ref:`Diagnostics for Physical Components <Diagsphy>`
   #. :ref:`Diagnostics for Biogeochemical Components <Diagsbiogeo>`

Prerequisite
==========================================

All the diagnostics scripts are written in Python. Users can follow this `instruction <https://github.com/NOAA-GFDL/CEFI-regional-MOM6/tree/feature/doc/tools#readme>`_ to create a `conda` environment to run these scripts.

Diagnostics for Physical Components
==========================================

All the diagnostics scripts related to the physical components are located within ``CEFI-regional-MOM6/diagnostics/physics``. Users can check the header of each file to learn how to use these scripts. Make sure you create ``figures`` folder before running the scripts.

The :numref:`Table %s <Diagsphytable>` below provides short descriptions for scripts related to physical components
