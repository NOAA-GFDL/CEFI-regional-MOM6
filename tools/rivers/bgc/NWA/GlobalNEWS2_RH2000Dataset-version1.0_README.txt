Yld_<NF>	Modeled nutrient form yield, in element mass units (e.g., kg N/km2/yr)	kg/km2/yr

continent, ocean, sea and seabasin are based on STN-30p assignments,
  with some corrections or modifications applied by the Global NEWS group.
  ocean, sea and seabasin are intended to be a hierarchical set of regions: ocean > sea > seabasin
continent:  Africa, Australia, Europe, North America, North Asia, Oceania, Oceans, South America, South Asia
   For continents, "Oceans" represents small, remote islands; total loads from these islands are trivial at the global scale,
   but these land cells and their continent label were present in the source basins dataset and are included for completeness.
ocean:  Arctic Ocean, Atlantic Ocean, Indian Ocean, Mediterranean+Black Sea, Pacific Ocean, Land
   "Land" is the label used for endorheic basins; there are 164 such basins.
<NF>: The nutrient form (not including TSS): DIN, DIP, DON, DOP, DOC, DSi, PN, PP, POC
