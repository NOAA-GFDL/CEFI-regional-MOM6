Archive Title: Model output and analysis codes for initial submission of "A regional physical-biogeochemical ocean model for marine resource applications in the Northeast Pacific (MOM6-COBALT-NEP10k v1.0)" to GMD
Directory: Figure_25

Contents:
   - Jupyter Notebook: Interpolate_NEP_to_CalCOFI.ipynb

	Details: This notebook interpolates NEP10k dissolved oxygen output to CalCOFI stations and sampling times

        Prerequisits:
           - Python packages listed in python_env.txt "shared" directory
           - nep_calcofi_grid.nc grid file located in this directory  
           - Acquire:

                - California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) Station Positions: https://calcofi.org/downloads/maps/CalCOFIStationOrder.csv
                - California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations (CalCOFI) Bottle Database: https://calcofi.org/data/oceanographic-data/bottle-database/
                        - 194903-202010_Bottle.csv (or latest name of file from download - this gets updated with CalCOFI dataset - it will need to match in the Jupyter notebook)    
	   - Generates:
  
		- nep_calcofi_values

   - Jupyter Notebook: Figure25_NEP_CalCOFI_O2_trend_comparisons.ipynb
	
	Details: This notebook generates Figure 25 in the above mentioned manuscript.

			- 194903-202010_Bottle.csv (or latest name of file from download - this gets updated with CalCOFI dataset - it will need to match in the Jupyter notebook)	

   - NetCDF file: nep_calcofi_grid.nc
	Details: CalCOFI Region spatial subset of NEP10k domain grid for expedited interpolation purposes 

   - NetCDF file: nep_calcofi_o2_1993-2019_ts.nc 	
	Details: Monthly mean dissolved oxygen output timeseries from NEP10k hindcast simulation, spatially subset to the CalCOFI region. File consist of 324 months of dissolved oxygen concentration (o2) over all model depths

   - csv file: nep_calcofi_values
	Details: Generated by the notebook Interpolate_NEP_to_CalCOFI.ipynb
