Archive Title: Model output and analysis codes for initial submission of "A regional physical-biogeochemical ocean model for marine resource applications in the Northeast Pacific (MOM6-COBALT-NEP10k v1.0)" to GMD
Directory: Figure_6

Contents:

   - Python Script: compute_tides

	Details: This script was developed by Andrew C. Ross at GFDL and uses hourly sea surface height to calculate amplitude of different tidal constituents.     

        Prerequisits:

           - Python packages listed in python_env.txt "shared" directory
           - ocean_hgrid.nc file located in this directory 
           - at least one month of hourly ssh model output (ssh_1993.nc in this directory)

	Code Expecution: The call to this script for the above mentioned above was
	
	   python compute_tides.py ocean_hgrid.nc ssh_1993.nc NEP_tides.nc  1
 

   - NetCDF file: ocean_hgrid.nc

        Details: Model supergrid used for NEP10k hindcast simulation 


   - NetCDF file: ssh_1993.nc

        Details: Model output from NEP10k hindcast simulation - hourly sea surface height (ssh) from January 1, 1993 - April 1, 1993.


   - NetCDF file: NEP_tides.nc

        Details: Results of running the "compute_tides.py" script. Specific call used:
                        python compute_tides.py ocean_hgrid.nc ssh_1993.nc NEP_tides.nc  1


   - Jupyter Notebook: Figure6_NEP_tides.ipynb
	
	Details: This notebook was derived from code developed by Andrew C. Ross at GFDL and generates Figure 6 in the above mentioned manuscript.  

	Prerequisits:
	   - Python packages listed in python_env.txt "shared" directory
	   - NEP_ocean_static_nomask.nc grid file located in "shared" directory  
	   - Acquire:

            - Generate monthly mean climatology (1993-2019) for CMEMS adt and store/link in this directory with the following naming convention:
                (NOTE: suggest spatialling subsetting large comparison datasets to NEP domain prior to temporal averaging)

		- CMEMS_adt_1993-2019_clim.nc

	   - Generate monthly mean climatology (1993-2019) for GLORYS12 zos and store/link in this directory with the following naming convention:
