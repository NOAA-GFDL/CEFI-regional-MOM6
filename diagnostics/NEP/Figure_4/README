Archive Title: Model output and analysis codes for initial submission of "A regional physical-biogeochemical ocean model for marine resource applications in the Northeast Pacific (MOM6-COBALT-NEP10k v1.0)" to GMD
Directory: Figure_4

Contents:
	
   - Jupyter Notebook: Figure4_MLD_dBM_GLORYS_comparison.ipynb
	
	Details: This notebook generates Figure 4 in the above mentioned manuscript.  

	Prerequisits:
	   - Python packages listed in python_env.txt "shared" directory
	   - NEP_ocean_static_nomask.nc grid file located in "shared" directory  
	   - Acquire: 

		- de Boyer Montégut Mixed layer depth over the global ocean: https://doi.org/10.17882/98226
			- Mixed layer depth 		 (mld_dr003)

                - GLORYS12: https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021 
			- Temperature			 (thetao)
 			- Salinity                       (so)
			- Bathymetry 			 (deptho)


	   - Rename de Boyer MontégutNetCDF file with the following naming convention and store/link in this directory:
		- mld_dr003_ref5m_v2024.nc 

	   - Generate monthly mean temperature and salinity NetCDF files (both variables in the same year-month file) and if using daily mean GLORYS files, and store/link in this directory with the following naming convention:
		(NOTE: suggest spatialling subsetting large comparison datasets to NEP domain prior to temporal averaging)

		- GLORYS_REANALYSIS_NEP_YYYY_MM.tmp.nc; where YYYY indicates the year and MM indicates the 2-didget month code

	   - Generate NEP spatial subset of bathymetry file (if spatially subset temperature and salinity fields), and store/link in this directory with the following naming convention:
		
		- glorys_nep_mask.nc


   - NetCDF file: nep_MLD_003_1993-2019_clim.nc
	
	Details: Model output from NEP10k hindcast simulation for monthly climatology of 1993-2019 mixed layer depth defined using the density threshold criterion of 0.03 kg/m3 from the potential density value at the reference depth of 5 m
