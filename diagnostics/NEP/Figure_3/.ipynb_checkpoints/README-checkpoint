Archive Title: Model output and analysis codes for initial submission of "A regional physical-biogeochemical ocean model for marine resource applications in the Northeast Pacific (MOM6-COBALT-NEP10k v1.0)" to GMD
Directory: Figure_3

Contents:
	
   - Jupyter Notebook: Figure3_NEP_WOA_GLORYS_salinity_comparison.ipynb
	
	Details: This notebook generates Figure 3 in the above mentioned manuscript.  

	Prerequisits:
	   - Python packages listed in python_env.txt "shared" directory
	   - NEP_ocean_static_nomask.nc grid file located in "shared" directory  
	   - Acquire:

		- NCEI Northern North Pacific Regional Climatology Version 2: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/northern-north-pacific-regional-climatology
			- Salinity, Decadal means 1995-2004; 2005-2014		 (s_an)

	 	- NCEI Northeast Pacific Regional Climatology: https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/northeast-pacific-regional-climatology
			- Salinity, Decadeal means 1995-2004; 2005-2012                 (s_an)

                - GLORYS12 Salinity: https://doi.org/10.48670/moi-00021 
 			- Salinity                       (so) 

           - Generate via concatenation the decadal mean salinity timeseries NetCDF files for nnp and nep and store in this directory:

		- nep_95B2_s00_10.nc
		- nnp_95B4_s00_10.nc		

	   - Generate annual mean salinity timeseries NetCDF files and store in this directory:
		(NOTE: suggest spatialling subsetting large comparison datasets to NEP domain prior to temporal averaging)

		- glorys_so_1993-2019_mean_ts.nc

   - NetCDF files: nep_so_1993-2019_mean_ts.nc, nep_so_1995-2014_mean_ts.nc
	
	Details: Model output from NEP10k hindcast simulation. Files consist of 27 years and 20 years, respectively, of annual mean ocean salinity (so) over all depths
