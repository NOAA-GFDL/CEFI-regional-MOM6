Contents:
	
   - Jupyter Notebook: Figure24_W_map_and_CUTI_comparisons.ipynb
	
	Details: This notebook generates Figure 24 in the above mentioned manuscript.  

	Prerequisits:
	   - Python packages listed in python_env.txt "shared" directory
	   - NEP_ocean_static_nomask.nc grid file located in "shared" directory  
	   - Acquire:

		- Coastal Upwelling Transport Index (CUTI): https://oceanview.pfeg.noaa.gov/products/upwelling/dnld
			- CUTI_daily.csv 
			
   - NetCDF file:   ccs_grid.nc

	Details: California Current System spatial subset of NEP10k domain grid for expedited calculation and data storage purposes


   - NetCDF files:  ccs_umo_vmo_YYYY.nc where YYYY indicates the years 1993 through 2019 
	
	Details: Monthly mean horizontal ocean mass transports (umo, vmo) from NEP10k hindcast simulation, spatially subset to the California Current System, that were used to calculate vertical mass transport and vertical velocity. 
		 Files consist of 12 monthly means each.
